<h1>Titles and headings</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This page shows how to make headings and title of different levels.

<h3>Sub-sections</h3>

You can use headings to subdivide your writing.

<h2>Levels of heading</h2>

You can intersperse different levels, but using more than three or four is
probably going to be confusing for the reader.

<h3>Level 3</h3>
<h4>Level 4</h4>
<h5>Level 5</h5>
<h6>Level 6</h6>

Meaning this is probably a bad idea.
